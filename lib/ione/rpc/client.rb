module Ione
  module Rpc
    # This is the base class of client peers.
    #
    # You can either create a subclass and add your own high-level convenience
    # methods for constructing and sending your custom requests, or you can
    # create a standalone client object and call {#send_request}.
    #
    # A subclass may optionally implement {#initialize_connection} to send a
    # message immediately on a successful connection, and {#choose_connection}
    # to decide which connection to use for a request.
    #
    # The client will handle connections to multiple server peers, and
    # automatically reconnect to them when they disconnect.
    class Client
      # Create a new client with the specified codec and options.
      #
      # @param [Object] codec the protocol codec to use to encode requests and
      #   decode responses. See {Ione::Rpc::Codec}.
      # @param [Hash] options
      # @option options [Array<String>] :hosts the host (and ports) to connect
      #   to, specified either as an array of host (String) and port (Integer)
      #   pairs (e.g. `[['host1', 1111], [`host2`, 2222]]`) or an array of
      #   strings on the format host:port (e.g. `['host1:1111', 'host2:2222']`).
      # @option options [Ione::Io::IoReactor] :io_reactor use this option to
      #   make the client use an existing IO reactor and not create its own.
      #   Please note that {#stop} will still stop the reactor.
      # @option options [Integer] :connection_timeout (5) the number of seconds
      #   to wait for connections to be established before failing.
      # @option options [Integer] :max_channels (128) the maximum number of
      #   channels supported for each connection.
      # @option options [Logger] :logger a logger conforming to the standard
      #   Ruby logger API that will be used to log significant events like
      #   request failures.
