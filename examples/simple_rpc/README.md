# Simple RPC

This example shows how you can create a client and server that communicate using JSON encoded messages.

## How to run

Start the server by running `./examples/simple_rpc/bin/server`, and then run the client in another terminal with `./examples/simple_rpc/bin/client pi` or `./examples/simple/bin/client tau`.

Run the tests with `rspec examples/simple_rpc/spec/ione/simple_rpc_spec.rb`
